<h1>Metro Bike Share Vision Statement</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    The project should tell the story of Metro Bike Share (MBS).  Here is the definition of "tell
    the story".  There will be a narrative consisting of several short paragraphs.  Each paragraph
    will communicate an aspect of MBS.  With each paragraph there will be a visualization
    supporting the paragraph.  When we present the project, we will recite the paragraphs,
    pointinout the supporting information in the associated visualization.  This will give the
    audience a "context" that will enable them to understand what MBS is and how it became what it
    is today.
</p>
    

<h3>Paragraph 1:  Then and Now</h3>
<p>
    The first paragraph will be a summary of how MBS was conceived and where it is today.
</p>
<p>
    The support visualization would be a timeline graph (temporal).  This timeline should events
    from original proposal, major milestones, and finally the current achievement.
</p>

<h3>Paragraph 2:  Growth and Seasonal Usage</h3>
<p>
    The next paragraph will talk about the growth of MBS and its seasonality.  
</p>
<p>
    There could be two bar graphs.  One showing growth over time.  The other showing average usage
    by month.
</p>

<h3>Paragraph 3:  Rider Composistion and Habits</h3>
<p>
    The next paragraph will talk about the composition of MBS riders and their ridding habits.  
</p>
    Pie chart will do for rider composition (nominal).  A bar chart will display the average number
    of rides during the time of day per season.
</p>

<h3>Paragraph 4:  Favorite Stations</h3>
<p>
    The next  paragraph will talk about the favorite starting stations, end stations, and routes.
    That information will be encoded on to a map of Los Angeles.  The database has the latitudes
    and longitudes for doing this (geospatial).
</p>

<h3>Paragraph 5:  Twitter</h3>
<p>
    Finally, if there is time, I could show a streamgraph of negative, neutral, and positive
    twitter references to MBS.
</p>

<h3>Time Constraint</h3>
<p>
    In total, that will be about six visualizations.  According to the syllabus, there is a 
    five-minute time limit on proposals, YouTube video, and presentation.  With six visualizations,
    we should be able to comply with the constraint.
